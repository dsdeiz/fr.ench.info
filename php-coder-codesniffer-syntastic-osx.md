## PHP, Coder, Code Sniffer, and Syntastic in OS X

I originally used the PHP package bundled with OS X. This doesn't seem to be easily maintainable since you would have an outdated PHP version. I've since replaced this with [`homebrew-php`](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-php) specifically the package `php54` with the `phpdbg` flag.
